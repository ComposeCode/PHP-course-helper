# PHP - An Introduction

## Who is this course for?

This course is designed for those looking to gain a basic understanding of PHP or break into web development. Knowledge of basic HTML is required but knowledge of JavaScript isn't required.

The syntax of PHP is similar to languages such as C++, C, Java and you may find this course useful if you're already familiar with those programming languages. I'd recommend this course if you just need a quick reference to PHP or if you're totally starting from scratch.

PHP is still pretty popular but has been somewhat overtaken by Node.js, Python (using Django or other frameworks) and Ruby (using Rails and other frameworks). Despite this, it is still heavily used within content management systems like Wordpress, Drupal and Magento which are still very popular. If you're looking to start developing with one of those frameworks, this course will provide a great foundation.
